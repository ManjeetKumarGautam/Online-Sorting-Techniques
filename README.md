# Online-Sorting-Techniques
Retrieval of information is made easier when it is stored in some predefined order. Sorting is, therefore, a very important computer application activity. Many sorting algorithms are available. Different environments require different sorting methods. Sorting algorithms can be characterised in the following two ways:
1.	Simple algorithms which require the order of n2 (written as O(n2 ))comparisons to sort n items.
2.	Sophisticated algorithms that require the O(nlog2n) comparisons to sort n items.
